## Data Visualization - Google Maps - Restaurants Populartimes

### Background

The restaurant populartimes will display how busy all the restaurants in Manhattan are during the different hours in the day / days of the week.

### Functionality & MVP

Users should be able to see:

- [ ] Location of restaurants in Manhattan area which have popular times info
- [ ] See the time and day of the week of the current visual that is being displayed
- [ ] Allow for time to playout visually within a day with changing data.
- [ ] Toggle between different days of the week to see how populartimes change.

In addition, this project will include:
- [ ] A production README

### Wireframes

This data visualization will consist of a single page with checkbox or dropdown to select the day of the week on the side to toggle the different days of the week and the start and pause animation button. The other component will be a google maps visual showing the map with populated datapoints.

**Day 3**: Style google maps

Goals for the day:
- have map populated with information, some user generated changes


**Day 4**: Install the controls for the user to interact with the front end, changing the day of the week, Style the webpage accordingly
